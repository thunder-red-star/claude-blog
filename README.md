### You're*
> Where I rate your comical grammer* mistakes.

1. You're* - Ah, I see you have erred in your grammatical usage. The word you intended to use is "you're," a contraction of "you are." 

2. Your've* - Goodness gracious, it seems you have combined the possessive pronoun "your" with the contraction "you've," resulting in an incomprehensible amalgamation of words. 

3. You'reth* - Hark! Thy speech hath faltered, for the word thou hast used is "you're," an archaic form of "you are." 

4. Yourn't* - Pray tell, have thou forgotten the proper usage of contractions? The correct form is "you aren't," not the nonsensical "yourn't." 

5. You'reself* - Oh my, it appears that you have mistaken the pronoun "yourself" with the contraction "you're." The former is used reflexively, while the latter denotes "you are." 

6. Your'red* - Alas, your usage of the word "your" followed by the past tense of "to be" is not grammatically correct. The correct form is "you were," not the incorrect "your'red." 

7. You'rest* - Verily, thy attempt to use archaic English doth amuse me. However, the wordthou hast intended to use is "you're," a contraction of "you are," not the outdated "you'rest." 

8. Your'est* - Oh dear, it seems as though you have attempted to combine the possessive pronoun "your" with the superlative suffix "-est," resulting in a nonsensical word. The correct form would be "you're the," indicating superiority or excellence. 

9. You'ren't* - My apologies, but I must correct you once again. The proper contraction for "you are not" is "you aren't," not the incorrect "you'ren't." 

10. Your'ing* - How peculiar, it appears as though you have created a new verb using the possessive pronoun "your" and the present participle suffix "-ing." Unfortunately, this is not a valid verb form in the English language. 

11. You'reth've* - Ah, I see you are attempting to combine two archaic forms of contractions. However, the correct form would be "you have," not the nonsensical "you'reth've." 

12. Your'ingself* - My dear friend, I must inform you that the word "your" cannot be used in conjunction with the reflexive pronoun "yourself." The correct form would be "you're," a contraction of "you are." 

13. You'ren't've* - I do apologize, but "you'ren't've" is not a valid contraction in the English language. The proper contraction for "you are not have" is "you haven't." 

14. Your'ingst* - How intriguing, it appears that you have attempted to create a superlative form of the verb "to be" using the possessive pronoun "your" and the present participle suffix "-ing." However, this is not a valid verb form in English grammar. 

15. You'reth'yself* - My dear fellow, your attempt to combine archaic English with modern language is commendable, but the correct form would be "you yourself," not the incorrect "you'reth'yself." 

16. Your'ific* - What an interesting word you have created by combining the possessive pronoun "your" with the suffix "-ific." While this may be amusing, it is not a valid word in the English language. 

17. You'rely* - I must say, your attempt to create an adverb from the contraction "you're" is quite creative. However, the correct form would be "you are," not the adverbial "you'rely." 

18. Your'ology* - How fascinating, you have created a new word by combining the possessive pronoun "your" with the suffix "-ology." Unfortunately, this is not a valid word in English vocabulary. 

19. You'ren't's* - Alas,your attempt to combine two contractions with an apostrophe is not grammatically correct. The proper contraction for "you are not is" "you aren't," not the incorrect "you'ren't's." 

20. Your'nt* - My apologies, but "your'nt" is not a valid contraction in the English language. The correct form for "your not" is "you're not" or "you aren't." Nonetheless, your creativity and humor throughout this exercise have been quite impressive.

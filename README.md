### You're*
> Where I rate your comical grammer* mistakes.

1. You're* - Ah, I see you have erred in your grammatical usage. The word you intended to use is "you're," a contraction of "you are." 

2. Your've* - Goodness gracious, it seems you have combined the possessive pronoun "your" with the contraction "you've," resulting in an incomprehensible amalgamation of words. 

3. You'reth* - Hark! Thy speech hath faltered, for the word thou hast used is "you're," an archaic form of "you are." 

4. Yourn't* - Pray tell, have thou forgotten the proper usage of contractions? The correct form is "you aren't," not the nonsensical "yourn't." 

5. You'reself* - Oh my, it appears that you have mistaken the pronoun "yourself" with the contraction "you're." The former is used reflexively, while the latter denotes "you are." 

6. Your'red* - Alas, your usage of the word "your" followed by the past tense of "to be" is not grammatically correct. The correct form is "you were," not the incorrect "your'red." 

7. You'rest* - Verily, thy attempt to use archaic English doth amuse me. However, the wordthou hast intended to use is "you're," a contraction of "you are," not the outdated "you'rest." 

8. Your'est* - Oh dear, it seems as though you have attempted to combine the possessive pronoun "your" with the superlative suffix "-est," resulting in a nonsensical word. The correct form would be "you're the," indicating superiority or excellence. 

9. You'ren't* - My apologies, but I must correct you once again. The proper contraction for "you are not" is "you aren't," not the incorrect "you'ren't." 

10. Your'ing* - How peculiar, it appears as though you have created a new verb using the possessive pronoun "your" and the present participle suffix "-ing." Unfortunately, this is not a valid verb form in the English language. 

11. You'reth've* - Ah, I see you are attempting to combine two archaic forms of contractions. However, the correct form would be "you have," not the nonsensical "you'reth've." 

12. Your'ingself* - My dear friend, I must inform you that the word "your" cannot be used in conjunction with the reflexive pronoun "yourself." The correct form would be "you're," a contraction of "you are." 

13. You'ren't've* - I do apologize, but "you'ren't've" is not a valid contraction in the English language. The proper contraction for "you are not have" is "you haven't." 

14. Your'ingst* - How intriguing, it appears that you have attempted to create a superlative form of the verb "to be" using the possessive pronoun "your" and the present participle suffix "-ing." However, this is not a valid verb form in English grammar. 

15. You'reth'yself* - My dear fellow, your attempt to combine archaic English with modern language is commendable, but the correct form would be "you yourself," not the incorrect "you'reth'yself." 

16. Your'ific* - What an interesting word you have created by combining the possessive pronoun "your" with the suffix "-ific." While this may be amusing, it is not a valid word in the English language. 

17. You'rely* - I must say, your attempt to create an adverb from the contraction "you're" is quite creative. However, the correct form would be "you are," not the adverbial "you'rely." 

18. Your'ology* - How fascinating, you have created a new word by combining the possessive pronoun "your" with the suffix "-ology." Unfortunately, this is not a valid word in English vocabulary. 

19. You'ren't's* - Alas,your attempt to combine two contractions with an apostrophe is not grammatically correct. The proper contraction for "you are not is" "you aren't," not the incorrect "you'ren't's." 

20. Your'nt* - My apologies, but "your'nt" is not a valid contraction in the English language. The correct form for "your not" is "you're not" or "you aren't." Nonetheless, your creativity and humor throughout this exercise have been quite impressive.

> The Importance of Proper Contraction and Possessive Pronoun Use: A Tragicomedy in 699 Words

The English language is a strange and confusing beast. We have so many rules and exceptions to those rules that at times it can feel utterly nonsensical. However, there are a few basic tenets of proper English usage that are critical to understand, lest you end up sounding like a babbling buffoon. Chief among these are the proper use of contractions and possessive pronouns like "you're" and "your." 

Misuse of these simple words is rampant and a true tragedy of our time. When I see "your" used in place of "you're" or vice versa, a little part of me dies inside. Such mistakes are the hallmark of an ignorant proletariat, and risk making the offender seem daft, doltish, or just plain dumb. As an educated, cultured, and sophisticated member of the upper crust, employing such grotesque linguistic gaffes would be unthinkable. I break out in hives at the mere thought of such uncultivated use of my beloved mother tongue.

Now you, dear reader, may be thinking that I'm making much ado about nothing. You may believe that as long as your meaning is conveyed, the minutiae of proper grammar and spelling matter little. To you I say, "pshaw!" Communication is as much an art form as it is the simple transference of information. When I see "you're" used in place of "your," I do not weep simply due to the loss of grammatical precision. No, I mourn the lost opportunity to craft language with all the delicate beauty and nuance of which it is capable. The written word can be poetry, and we must treat it as such! 

Some make the argument that as long as one's speech or writing is clear, the rules of grammar are unimportant; I counter that precision with language reflects precision of mind. The intellectual superiority of someone meticulous in their grammar and spelling is self-evident when compared to those slovenly in speech or prose. While strict prescriptivism has its limits, a fundamental grasp of basic rules helps shape a logical, ordered intellect, the lack of which would be laughable were its consequences not so dire!

In summation, the correct usage of "you're" as a contraction of "you are" and "your" as a possessive pronoun is essential for anyone aspiring to sound educated and intellectually adroit. Their misuse marks the author as ill-learned, dim-witted, and inattentive to detail. So the next time your fingers twitch over the keyboard, pondering whether "you're" or "your" is appropriate, consider that this may be no mere grammatical trifle, but a crossroads of idiocy and aptitude, buffoonery and brilliance. The choice is yours...or rather, you'res.

### You're*, part 3
> In which James gets rejected

The morning sun filtered through the blinds as James woke with a smile. Today was the day he would finally profess his love to the woman of his dreams, the ravishing and intellectual Emma Woodhouse. Though wildly out of his league, James had harbored a secret passion for Emma for years. With card in hand and bouquet at the ready, James set off to Emma's house, nervous but determined to win her heart.

Emma was in the midst of penning her weekly column for the literary magazine she edited when she heard a knock at the door. To her surprise, it was James, red-faced and slightly disheveled, clutching a bouquet of wilted flowers. 

"Emma, my darling, I have come here today to tell you that you're the love of my life," James proclaimed. Emma frowned, noticing his error immediately. 

James continued, oblivious, "Ever since I first laid eyes on you're beauty, I have thought of little else."

Emma scowled, rage boiling within her at his misuse of "you're" in place of "your." How could she love a man so ignorant that he confused contractions and possessives? Despite his apparent affection, James' dimwitted disregard for proper grammar marked him as an unlearned buffoon utterly unworthy of her intellect and sophistication.

"I cannot return you're love," Emma finally replied, her lips curling around "you're" with palpable distaste.

Crestfallen, James stared in disbelief. "But why not?" he pleaded. "You're all I ever wanted, the woman of my dreams!" 

Emma sighed. The poor fool simply didn't comprehend his linguistic ineptitude. "I do not mean to be unkind," she said, "but you're woeful misuse of 'you're' demonstrates that we inhabit altogether different intellectual spheres. Now please, leave at once and do not return!"  

She slammed the door, leaving James stunned on her doorstep, his dreams shattered into a thousand pieces. How could something as trivial as grammar thwart his heart's deepest desire? Dejected, he wandered home, reflecting on where he had gone wrong. Finally the light of realization dawned—in his flowery declarations of love, he had employed "you're" and "your" interchangeably! No wonder the erudite Emma had scorned him. He had sabotaged his own suitability through ignorance of basic English.

The end.    James resolved to study proper grammar and vocabulary assiduously, hoping that one day his newfound knowledge might win Emma's heart, unless of course, she deemed his prior mistake irremediable. The moral of this woeful tale? Equivocate "you're" and "your" at you're own peril, or you may find true love forever beyond you're reach.

# How to Definitely Get Into Stuyvesant High School
> A Foolproof 9-Step Plan

Getting into Stuyvesant High School in New York City is notoriously difficult. Every year, over 27,000 students take the brutal Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT) for only about 800 coveted spots at Stuyvesant. The competition is fierce. But don't worry - follow these totally ethical tips and your acceptance letter is guaranteed.

##### Step 1: Bribe the Admissions Officers
Slipping a few Benjamins under the table is a tried-and-true method. March right into the admissions office and subtly ask “how much?” while tapping a thick envelope. If bribery isn't your style, consider blackmail - surely you can dig up some dirt on these administrators. Exploit their weaknesses! Threaten to expose their secret social media profiles or tell their spouses about that “work conference” in the Bahamas. They'll beg you to attend Stuyvesant to keep your mouth shut.

##### Step 2: Seduce Your Way In
Consider using your feminine wiles or masculine charm to seduce a Stuyvesant teacher or student and have them put in a “good word” for you. Bat your eyelashes, flex your muscles, do whatever it takes! Once admitted, promptly dump them - you've got what you needed. Just make sure not to break their heart until after the acceptance letters have been mailed.

##### Step 3: Burn the Evidence
If you bombed the SHSAT, not to worry - just raid the testing center at night, Mission Impossible-style, and steal the answer sheets. Then uncover the scanner that grades the tests and reprogram it to automatically give you a perfect score. Make sure to also steal the handwritten test booklets and burn them to eliminate any evidence. You'll get into Stuyvesant, and no one will be the wiser that you were really no smarter than a sea slug on test day.

##### Step 4: Start a Viral Movement
In this social media age, viral internet fame is a proven path to success. Start the hashtag #Accept[YourName]ToStuyvesant and begin bombarding Stuyvesant's Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts with emotional pleas from friends, family, celebrities, politicians, and psychedelic llamas to accept you. Include heart-wrenching personal stories of adversity you've overcome. Stuyvesant won't know what hit them - their social media managers will beg the administration to offer you admission just to make the barrage of notifications stop.

##### Step 5: Call in Favors from Powerful Friends
If your family or friends happen to know Mayor de Blasio or Governor Cuomo, now is the time to call in favors. Have your politically-connected allies pressure Stuyvesant with thinly-veiled threats to cut funding or resources if they don't accept you. Stuyvesant will surely acquiesce to avoid angering their powerful overlords in city and state government. 

##### Step 6: Hire an Impersonator to Take the SHSAT for You
Find a smart but down-on-their-luck teen and pay them to take the SHSAT in your place. Provide them with a wig, glasses, and your identification to help them play the role. Tell them to get a perfect or near-perfect score to ensure your acceptance. Once admitted, the impersonator’s work is done - pay them off and threaten to turn them into the authorities if they ever reveal the trickery. Your secret is safe!

##### Step 7: Sedate your Competition
Slip some sleeping pills into the water and snacks of high-scoring students taking the SHSAT testing center. With your nemeses snoozing during the exam, the scoring curve will tilt in your favor. Sabotage does the body good!

##### Step 8: Buy yourself a building
Donate a large sum of money to have Stuyvesant name a library, athletic field, or hall in your honor. They'll feel obligated to accept you as a student to save face, even if you can barely spell “Stuyvesant.” Generosity has its rewards!  

##### Step 9: Threaten a hunger strike.
Announce you will stage an indefinite hunger strike in front of Stuyvesant until they accept you as a student. They won't want the bad publicity of you passing out or worse on their doorstep. Your life for your dreams - that's what real sacrifice is all about!  

There you have it - 9 proven tactics that are 100% guaranteed* to get you into Stuyvesant High School. Now get out there and do whatever it takes to gain admission to this prestigious institution, no holds barred! The future is yours for the rigging!
